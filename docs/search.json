    "text": "This report was comissioned by the Commission to Analyze Taxpayer spending. As an incoming technical analyst, I was appointed to investigate several areas of interest that pertained to the way the city handles it’s payroll bill. The following analysis seeks to uncover interesting trends that will aide city stakeholders in their decision making process on how to handle it’s finances. This is followed by several recommended policies that the city wants to undertake, and a third policy underwritten by the team on how New York City can get it’s spending under control.\nEric L. Adams is the current New York City mayor until 2025. Below, we examine his journey from being a borough president in FY 2014 until his ascendancy to become the Mayor of New York City in 2023. His current salary for being Mayor was $258,720 in 2024.\n\n\n\nMayor Adams Salary by Fiscal Year\n\n\nFiscal Year\nTotal Salary\nPosition\nAgency\n\n\n\n\n2014\n160000\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2015\n160000\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2016\n179200\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2017\n179200\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2018\n179200\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2019\n179200\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2020\n179200\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2021\n179200\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2022\n437950\nBorough President\nBorough President-Brooklyn\n\n\n2023\n258750\nMayor\nOffice Of The Mayor\n\n\n2024\n258750\nMayor\nOffice Of The Mayor"

Before we move into recommending a cap on all salaries to the Mayor’s, each position must be reviewed on a case by case basis. Although we know that we can save up $2.6 million, there are some critical city agencies such as the Comptroller, Department of Education and New York City Police Department that could have talent gutted if the suggestion is followed.\nThe first department to scrutinize is the New York City Housing Authority, which shows over half a million in total excess. This agency, responsible for affordable housing for city residents, has a history of payment abuses; notably, NYCHA Chairman Gregory Russ resigned after receiving a salary exceeding $414,000 during his tenure."
